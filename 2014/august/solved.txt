Working on robots.txt link which is accessed by search engines for indexing.
It was supposed to be of mime type or content type text/plain.
Tried with 
  1. @RequestMapping(produces="text/plain")
  2. public String robotsTxt(HttpServletResponse response) {
      response.setContentType("text/plain");
     }
  3. response.setHeader("Content-type", "text/plain");
nothing worked. It was still treated as html.
Finally using ResponseEntity worked

  HttpHeaders responseHeaders = new HttpHeaders();
  responseHeaders.setContentType(MediaType.TEXT_PLAIN);
  return new ResponseEntity<String>("Any text with new line \n next line here.",responseHeaders, HttpStatus.OK );
